## scOPE workflow (transfer learning from bulk → single-cell)

**scOPE (single-cell Oncological Prediction Explorer)** is a transfer-learning framework that uses *bulk RNA-seq cohorts with known mutation status* to learn a compact, biologically meaningful latent space, then projects *single-cell RNA-seq* into that same space to predict the probability that **specific cancer-associated gene mutations** are present in individual cells. This provides mutation-informed subclonal structure that can complement CNV-based approaches and increase subclonal granularity.

### Overview

scOPE proceeds in two phases:

### 1) Learn latent factors from bulk RNA-seq and train mutation classifiers (Panels a–c)

1. **Bulk expression matrix**
   Construct a bulk cohort expression matrix **A_bulk** (rows = patient samples, columns = genes).
   The bulk matrix is **normalized / centered / scaled** to ensure comparable gene-wise signal.

2. **Latent feature mapping via SVD**
   Decompose the normalized bulk matrix using SVD:

   [
   A_{\text{bulk}} = U_{\text{bulk}} , \Sigma_{\text{bulk}} , V^\top
   ]

   * **U_bulk**: sample scores (rows = patients, columns = latent factors)
   * **Σ_bulk**: diagonal singular values
   * **V** (from (V^\top)): gene loadings (rows = genes, columns = latent factors)

   Define the bulk latent representation:

   [
   Z_{\text{bulk}} = U_{\text{bulk}} , \Sigma_{\text{bulk}}
   ]

3. **Train mutation-prediction models in latent space**
   For each mutation / gene-of-interest, train a supervised ML model to predict mutation presence **Y** from **Z_bulk**.
   This yields one (or multiple) mutation-specific classifiers operating on the learned latent factors.

### 2) Project scRNA-seq into the bulk-derived latent space and predict mutations per cell (Panels d–f)

4. **Single-cell expression matrix**
   Construct a single-cell expression matrix **A_sc** (rows = cells, columns = genes).

5. **Normalize scRNA-seq using bulk-derived parameters**
   Apply the *same* gene-wise normalization / centering / scaling learned from the bulk cohort to obtain **A′_sc**.
   (This is the key alignment step that makes the projection comparable across data types.)

6. **Project cells into latent space and infer mutation probabilities**
   Use the bulk-derived gene loadings **V** to compute the single-cell latent representation:

   [
   Z_{\text{sc}} = A'_{\text{sc}} , V
   ]

   Then apply the trained bulk models to **Z_sc** to predict **per-cell mutation probabilities**, producing mutation-informed cellular maps that can be analyzed alongside expression programs, clusters, and CNV signals.
